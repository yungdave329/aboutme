                <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River</h2>
                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. 
                    The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people 
                    living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in 
                    love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.

                    Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep
                    are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa 
                    pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or 
                    rain when needed.
                    
                    Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                    and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                    good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                    late summer's slower, warmer water more. </p>

            <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon</h3>

            <section class="msg2">
                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green
                    river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert 
                    scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to 
                    Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic 
                    formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                    Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
                    
                    Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the 
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

            <section class="msg3">
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your 
                    visit to the Grand Canyon.
                    
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly 
                    unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with 
                    side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
                    rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people 
                    are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
