      <h3>Weddings</h3>
      <p>
        You are at an exciting time in your life, and we are here to help you celebrate.
        As you just go engaged you probably need to get some pictures. You would
        at least need some for your wedding announcement. You would of course
        want a good picture of you new ring! We have our ideas of more traditional
        engagement photos, but we would also love if you any special poses you
        would like us to take of you guys. We can even recreate or even be there for
        your proposal; we will be stealthy, and they won’t even know we are there.
      </p>
      <p>Most people view their wedding day as the best and most important day of
        their life. With that you are getting married you are going to want someone
        who is a professional there to capture your special day. Your wedding day is
        when you feel your best and also look your best. We will be sure to get photos
        of your beautiful venue. We will take pictures of just the two of you, and we
        will take some of the different groups, such as your immediate family, your
        friends, and of course a big picture of all of your guests! </p>

      <h3>Individual</h3>
      <p>
        Are you looking to decorate your home, or are you looking for some good
        pictures? Whatever your reason is we are here for you. It is always good to
        have new photos of yourself and your family. If you don’t take new photos,
        your old photos will feel outdated. Now those pictures are important, but it
        is good to add to them and have pictures from different stages of your life
        and your family’s lives.</p>
      <p>We also love taking pictures of your pets! We know how important they are
        to you, and they are so cute! And honestly, what is better than a super cute
        picture of them? We are great at getting them set to take pictures, as we
        know this is very difficult for most people. We know that it can also be
        difficult in large groups of people, but we specialize in getting people set
        quickly as we do not want to waste your time or money.</p>
