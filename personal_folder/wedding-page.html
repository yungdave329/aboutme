    <h1>Our Weddings</h1>
    <p>You are at an exciting time in your life, and we are here to help you celebrate.
        As you just go engaged you probably need to get some pictures. You would
        at least need some for your wedding announcement. You would of course
        want a good picture of you new ring! We have our ideas of more traditional
        engagement photos, but we would also love if you any special poses you
        would like us to take of you guys. We can even recreate or even be there for
        your proposal; we will be stealthy, and they wonâ€™t even know we are there.</p>
